<h1>Motivational stories</h1>
<p>I have been inspired by these stories to be a better person and I hope they will inspire you to</p>
<h1>Elephant and the rope</h1>
<h2 style="color: coral;">There is a story called the elephant and the rope it goes:A man was walking through a elephant camp,he noticed the elephants weren’t kept in cages or fenced in all that kept them from escaping was a rope tied to one of their foot they could easily break through.Curious the man goes to ask a caretaker about this,the caretaker replies “We use the same to tie them as a baby then they can’t break free and they are conditioned to believe they can’t break through the rope”from this story we understand if we don’t try we will not be able to achieve our goals.</h2>
<h1>Thinking out of the box</h1>
<h2 style="color: coral;">The town merchant had a lovely daughter,he also had a debt to a man named Tom.When Tom came asking for his debt and saw the merchant's daughter he wanted to marry her but the merchant wouldn’t allow it.So Sam offered “I’ll pick a white and a black stone from the ground hide them one in each hand and I’ll let your daughter pick one if she picks the white stone I will forgive your debt but if she picks the black stone I forgive your debt and marry your daughter".Hesitantly the merchant agreed.When Sam went to pick up the 2 stone the daughter noticed he picked to black stones,at this point she had 2 option either marry Sam or confront him which would anger him.Instead she thought of a third option she chose one of the black stones from Sam’s hand and pretended to accidentally drop it then she said “I accidentally dropped it if you open your hand we will know which stone I picked”.When Sam opened his other hand and revealed the black stone they assumed the daughter must have picked the white stone.We understand from this story We sometimes will have to think outside the box and create our own choices.</h2>
